# ttlock-hass-integration

> **Unfortunately I am unable to maintain the project at the moment**. There are multiple variations of TTLocks that behave differently, also BLE communication is very unstable making things very difficult.  

**Work In Progress**: Manage and operate TTLock biometric locks locally from Home Assistant without the need of a gateway or the TTLock cloud.

## Features:
- Pair / reset locks  
- Manage permanent credentials (PIN codes, IC Cards, Fingerprints)  
- Lock / unlock  
- HA integration as a `lock` device

Please see [ttlock-hass-integration/README.md](./ttlock-hass-integration/README.md) for more information.
